\begin{problem}[Euclid]
Prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Let $n$ be a natural number, and suppose we can find $n$ prime numbers $p_1, \ldots, p_n$.
Then $N = p_1 \cdots p_n + 1$ is coprime to each $p_i$, so it has a prime factor $q$ different from any of the $p_i$'s.
Then $p_1,\ldots,p_n,q$ is a list of $n+1$ prime numbers.
It follows that, given any finite set of prime numbers, we can always find a prime number not in that set.
Therefore, there are infinitely many prime numbers.
This contradicts the assumption that there are only finitely many primes.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
\begin{parts}
\part
\label{2.a}
Prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
\part
\label{2.b}
Let $n$ be an integer greater than $1$.
Prove that the $n$th root of any prime number $p$ is irrational.
\end{parts}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
\ref{2.a}
If $\sqrt 2 = a / b$ for coprime integers $a$ and $b$, then $2 b^2 = a^2$,
so $a^2$ is even.
Then $a$ is also even, so $b^2 = 2 c^2$ for some integer $c$.
But then $b^2$ is even, hence $b$ is even.
This contradicts the assumption that $a$ and $b$ are coprime.

\ref{2.b}
The polynomial $f = x^n - p$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}$ by Eisenstein's
criterion.
By Gauss's Lemma, $f$ is also irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.
In particular, $f$ has no roots in $\mathbb Q$, so the $n$th root of $p$ is
irreducible.
\end{solution}
